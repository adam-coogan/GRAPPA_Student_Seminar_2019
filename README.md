This repository provides an overview and useful material for the GRAPPA Student Seminar 2019. After each lecture, the slides will be uploaded to the `slides/` folder.

Students will form several small groups, each of which will write codes each week to perform calculations related to dark matter, and present on a current topic in dark matter in the final week. After the groups are formed, each will be provided with a GitHub repository to which you can submit your code.
